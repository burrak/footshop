Refactoring exercise
===

How to start
---
1. Bootstrap database image with fixtures and install dependencies
```sh
$ make
```

2. Run application via built-in server
```sh
$ php -S localhost:8888 -t public
```

Purpose of exercise
---
The goal of this exercise is to identify bugs and wrongly designed parts of the working application. You can, of course, add and remove libraries and refactor as much as you want, but please don't rewrite it into any framework. Imagine that this is the only subset of a huge application, so this is not an option for now.

Please use git and commit changes continuously in some logical blocks so it's easier for me to understand your changes.
